# claculator

Simple TUI interface for exploring numbers in various numeral systems. It also
supports supports entering UTF-8 text to explore the character codes because
why not?

## Why in the world "claculator"??

Nobody is safe from nostalgia. Especially not me. When I started coding at 11
years old, I had the disadvantages of an 11 year old too. Namely: making
extremely useless programs like a crappy Java Swing calculator, and not double-checking spelling.

So if you feel like downloading my old Java Swing calculator, click:
<http://bit.ly/LEGOlord208-claculator-1-1>. Now you see where the name is from.

(In all seriousness, the old program had no license because I didn't know what
that was. So technically you have no right to decompile and steal any of the
code, but c'mon, who'd want to do that anyway? Even reading it will most likely
make your eyes blead)

## Want an actual calculator?

That's ok, I've actually made two:
